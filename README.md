## Background

WAKE UP SHEEPLE! The extra-terrestrial menace has come to Earth and the folks at `ALIENS-R-REAL` have collected all of the eye-witness reports they could get to prove it! As a good Earthling I decided to put this information online for the world to see and then the matter will finally be put to rest.

I wrote a code that creates a table dynamically based upon a [dataset](StarterCode/static/js/data.js). I also allowed users to filter the table data for specific values. I used JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and D3.js on to build the web page since they are the only coding languages that can be trusted :).

The break down of the procedures is outlined below.

### Automatic Table and Multiple Search Enteries

* Created a basic HTML web page [index.html](StarterCode/index.html).

* Used the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects to write code that appends a table to the web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

  * It consists of a column for `date/time`, `city`, `state`, `country`, `shape`, and `comment`.

* Used multiple select dropdowns to write JavaScript code so users can set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns:

  1. `date/time`
  2. `city`
  3. `state`
  4. `country`
  5. `shape`
